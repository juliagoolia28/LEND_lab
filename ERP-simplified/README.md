# Simplifying ERP analysis

## Author: Will Decker

The following script and functions combines and completely automates standard analysis steps using EEGLAB, ERPLAB and other plugins into simple functions that are easy to understand.

To begin working with ERP-simplified:

 * download the functins folder and add it to your MATLAB path.
 * Open *_ERP_simplified.m_*.
 * Read through the comments
 * Highlight individual functions and press cmd + shift + D to view their parameters/inputs.
 * Extract ERPs!

Note: MARA, an EEGLAB plugin is required.
